# Data_Science_Recommendation_Engines

## Experimental Design Use in Business
Completion of this course will help you understand the role that experiment design and testing can play in product design and development, as well as give you a solid background in the different types of recommendations that can be provided, how recommendation engines work, and how you can evaluate the quality of a recommendation engine.

Experimental design has many stakeholders, including the following:
Researchers
- Any time organizations are involved in actual experimenting, it is vital that proper protocol, best practice, and standard procedures are followed. This ensures privacy as well as reliability of data.
Data scientists
- Data scientists that collect data need to understand experiment design, including the most appropriate type of experiment or study to conduct based on their needs, evaluating the quality of an experiment, and also account for and mitigate biases in both the design of the experiment and also the collection of data.
Customers
- Most e-commerce sites are involved in A/B testing in order to try out new products, ideas, or interfaces. Organizations that implement professional and ethical experiments develop trust with their customers. Customers that have good experiences when interacting online with a company help build that rapport. Additionally, for companies that deal with recommendations (e.g. video streaming, product sales, or referrals), having accurate and helpful recommendations is vital to the customer experience.
eCommerce purchasing
- Teams supporting eCommerce will be able to evaluate a product or assess the data that has been collected related to a specific product.
Marketing/Advertising
- Marketers and advertisers base their short-term and long-term customer-facing initiatives on anticipated customer behavior and activity. Properly implemented experiments can generate powerful data to helps direct these initiatives.
